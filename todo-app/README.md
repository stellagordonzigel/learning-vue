learning vue todo-app

##Why did you choose this subject?
* I chose to begin learning vue because it has similarities to react and according to my instructors, it is becoming popular in the industry.

##What problem does it solve?
* Vue is approachable, versatile and performant. If you are familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Vue is a manageable framework to learn. It can be used with a core library, focusing on the view layer, or integrate with other libraries to create more sophisticated applications. (vuejs.org)

##Why does one use it?
* Alternatives to Vue are React, AngularJS (Angular 1), Angular, Ember, Knockout, Polymer, Riot
* Vue and React share similarities, they both use a virtual DOM and use a component structure, among other things.
* Vue and Angular JS share some similarities in syntax, because AngularJS was an inspiration for Vue.

##What is the history of Vue?
* Vue was created by Evan You who previously worked for Google using AngularJS. He wanted to create a lightweight framework based on the aspects of Angular that he liked. Vue was originally released in February of 2014. It is an MIT licensed open-source project. (wikipedia)

##What is your opinion of Vue after having built something with it?
* I enjoyed going through the Vue tutorial and after learning React, Vue seemed more straightforward, although I didn't have time to explore much of its capabilities. I think my familiarity with React definitely helped my understanding of the structure of Vue, including the use of components and props.
